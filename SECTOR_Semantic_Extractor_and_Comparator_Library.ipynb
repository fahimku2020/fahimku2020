        "SECTOR - Semantic Extractor and Comparator Library\n",
        "Sector is a Python library designed for advanced text extraction, comparison, and intelligent matching, serving as a robust LLM response evaluation tool. It enables users to pinpoint the most relevant sentences between an input and a reference document through sophisticated techniques like semantic alignment and customizable probabilistic matching, ensuring precise and context-aware comparisons. With a modular and highly configurable architecture, Sector empowers users to fine-tune each component to effectively evaluate the alignment, relevance, and accuracy of LLM-generated responses within complex contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional comparison techniques like BLEU, METEOR, and cosine similarity offer useful measures for surface-level similarity between strings but often fall short when comparing LLM responses in scenarios with extensive context and specific responses, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or concise summaries. Sector takes an engineering-driven approach to address this limitation by first extracting only the most relevant sections of the context, ensuring comparisons are focused on information crucial to the query or summary. This targeted extraction enables a precise alignment between context and response, allowing Sector to deliver a nuanced, context-aware evaluation. By complementing traditional metrics with this engineering-driven methodology, Sector provides a robust and accurate solution for LLM response evaluation in complex, context-rich AI generated content.\n",
