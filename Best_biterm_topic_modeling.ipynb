            "Amitabh Bachchan (pronounced [əmɪˈt̪ɑːbʱ ˈbətːʃən] ⓘ; born Amitabh Srivastava;[1] 11 October 1942[7]) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He is often considered one of the greatest, most accomplished and commercially successful actors in the history of Indian cinema.[8] With a cinematic career spanning over five decades, he has played pivotal roles in over 200 films. Bachchan is often hailed as the Shahenshah of Bollywood, Sadi Ke Mahanayak (translated as \"Greatest actor of the century\" in Hindi), Star of the Millennium, or simply Big B.[9] His dominance in the Indian film industry during the 1970s–80s led the French director François Truffaut to describe it as a \"one-man industry\".[10] He is a recipient of several accolades including six National Film Awards and sixteen Filmfare Awards.
