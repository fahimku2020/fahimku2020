From last month, multi-family starts were up in Saskatchewan and in Toronto.\\\"\\nIn Ottawa, CMHC recorded 297 starts in February, a twoper-cent drop from February 2010.\\nAcross Canada, urban housing starts rose 9.4 per cent to 161,000 units in February, with multiple-unit construction up 14.5 per cent to 94,900 units and single-unit activity rising three per cent to 66,100 units.\\nThe rate of urban starts fell 24.7 per cent in Atlantic Canada, while Quebec's total declined 7.1 per cent and British Columbia was down 5.9 per cent.\\nMeanwhile, urban construction was up 29.3 per cent in Ontario and 26.1 per cent in the Prairies.\\nRural housing starts totalled 20,900 units in February, down from an annual rate of 23,500 units the previous month.\\n\\\"Canadian residential construction activity appears to be stabilizing at a level consistent with underlying demographic demand,\\\" BMO Capital Markets economist Robert Kavcic said.\\n\\\"In the quarters ahead, home sales could be challenged by higher mortgage rates and shorter amortizations, which will eventually weigh on starts, but the maturing economic recovery should help.\\\"\\nKavcic said housing starts would total \\\"an undramatic\\\" 179,000 units for all of 2011, \\\"the same pace seen over the past six months.\\\"\\n\\\"We continue to expect a softening in overall housing starts, particularly with the anticipated higher interest rates and a slower second half of the year keeping home prices under wraps,\\\" CIBC World Markets economist Krishen Rangasamy said.\\nOn Monday, Statistics Canada reported the value of building permits fell in January because of weaker residential and non-residential activity. Permits were down 5.1 per cent to $5.4 billion during the month, after a gain of 2.6 per cent in December, which was revised upward from an initial reading of 2.4 per cent. Most economists had expected permits to edge up by between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent in January.\\nStatistics Canada will provide another piece to the housing picture on Thursday, when it releases its housing price index for January.\\nTighter mortgage rules -including shorter amortizations -that come into effect March 18, along with higher interest rates, lower affordability and elevated household debt, \\\"should keep house prices on a tight leash,\\\" BMO Capital Markets said in a report last week.\",\n          \"More than one-third of homes sold in Calgary's resale market from April to June were condos, say industry figures.  \\nOf 8,614 sales recorded by the Calgary Real Estate Board, 2,570 of them were condos -- with more than half, or 1,315, occurring in the board's area C, which encompasses the city's southwest.  \\nAnd again leading the city in sales was the area C community of Connaught, where 138 condo units changed hands from April to June at an average price of $271,672.  \\nVictoria Park was the second most active neighbourhood in the area with 66 sales at an average of $282,170.  \\nAs for average prices, Bayview checked in at the top of the list with a pair of sales that fetched an average of $868,500.  \\nEau Claire was next with a price of $612,269 for 21 deals.  \\nIn the board's area A, which covers primarily the northwest and part of the northeast, Rocky Ridge Ranch led in sales.  \\nThe community had 46 sales at an average selling price of $291,815, followed by Bridgeland, where 41 sales averaged $332,906.  \\nOne sale in Collingwood carried a pricetag of $557,300, followed by another single sale in Montgomery for $440,000.  \\nA couple of neighbouring communities in the northeast were first and second in sales in area B from April to June.  \\nPineridge had 34 sales averaging $198,597, while Rundle counted 30 sales at an average of $184,693.  \\nAnother pair of neighbours -- Martindale and Taradale -- had the highest average prices in area B at $262,350 and $233,666, respectively.  \\nDown in area D, which covers the city's southeast, McKenzie Towne led the sales parade with 66 at an average price of $263,047.  \\nIt was followed by Acadia, where 34 deals averaged $206,636.  \\nDouglasdale Estates recorded the highest average in the area at $360,000 for a single sale.  \\nMeanwhile, Inglewood had an average price of $337,942 for 21 sales.  \\nIn the board's return area outside the Calgary city limits, Airdrie led the sales parade with 67 sales at an average price of $221,925.  \\nThe highest average selling price was in Priddis Greens, where two sales averaged $482,250.  \",\n          \"Building permits in the Edmonton census metropolitan area slipped in February from last year's values.\\nMunicipalities in the region issued $284.8 million worth of permits in the month. That's down 26.3 per cent from February 2010, but up 20.9 per cent from the previous month, Statistics Canada said Thursday.\\nFor Alberta, the total value of building permits jumped to $1.47 billion. That's up 49.6 per cent from February 2010 and up 112 per cent from the previous month.\\nATB Financial\\n economist Dan Sumner said Alberta's permit values are at the highest level in three years because of a surge in non-residential projects. \\\"The Calgary airport terminal improvement project, valued at nearly $600 million, is the main reason for the increase,\\\" Sumner said.\\nHowever, the value of Alberta's residential building permits fell 35 per cent year-over-year and nearly six per cent month-over-month to $432 million. Sumner said that's the lowest level since June 2009 and indicates housing starts may not recover for a few months yet.\\n\\\"On the residential side of the equation, Edmonton was the primary factor behind February's decrease,\\\" Sumner said. \\\"After seeing a huge surge in residential permits during late 2009 and early 2010, residential construction intentions in the capital have trended back to more normal levels.\\\"\\nAcross Canada, municipalities issued $5.8 billion worth of building permits in February.

From last month, multi-family starts were up in Saskatchewan and in Toronto.\\\"\\nIn Ottawa, CMHC recorded 297 starts in February, a twoper-cent drop from February 2010.\\nAcross Canada, urban housing starts rose 9.4 per cent to 161,000 units in February, with multiple-unit construction up 14.5 per cent to 94,900 units and single-unit activity rising three per cent to 66,100 units.\\nThe rate of urban starts fell 24.7 per cent in Atlantic Canada, while Quebec's total declined 7.1 per cent and British Columbia was down 5.9 per cent.\\nMeanwhile, urban construction was up 29.3 per cent in Ontario and 26.1 per cent in the Prairies.\\nRural housing starts totalled 20,900 units in February, down from an annual rate of 23,500 units the previous month.\\n\\\"Canadian residential construction activity appears to be stabilizing at a level consistent with underlying demographic demand,\\\" BMO Capital Markets economist Robert Kavcic said.\\n\\\"In the quarters ahead, home sales could be challenged by higher mortgage rates and shorter amortizations, which will eventually weigh on starts, but the maturing economic recovery should help.\\\"\\nKavcic said housing starts would total \\\"an undramatic\\\" 179,000 units for all of 2011, \\\"the same pace seen over the past six months.\\\"\\n\\\"We continue to expect a softening in overall housing starts, particularly with the anticipated higher interest rates and a slower second half of the year keeping home prices under wraps,\\\" CIBC World Markets economist Krishen Rangasamy said.\\nOn Monday, Statistics Canada reported the value of building permits fell in January because of weaker residential and non-residential activity. Permits were down 5.1 per cent to $5.4 billion during the month, after a gain of 2.6 per cent in December, which was revised upward from an initial reading of 2.4 per cent. Most economists had expected permits to edge up by between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent in January.\\nStatistics Canada will provide another piece to the housing picture on Thursday, when it releases its housing price index for January.\\nTighter mortgage rules -including shorter amortizations -that come into effect March 18, along with higher interest rates, lower affordability and elevated household debt, \\\"should keep house prices on a tight leash,\\\" BMO Capital Markets said in a report last week.\",\n          \"More than one-third of homes sold in Calgary's resale market from April to June were condos, say industry figures.  \\nOf 8,614 sales recorded by the Calgary Real Estate Board, 2,570 of them were condos -- with more than half, or 1,315, occurring in the board's area C, which encompasses the city's southwest.  \\nAnd again leading the city in sales was the area C community of Connaught, where 138 condo units changed hands from April to June at an average price of $271,672.  \\nVictoria Park was the second most active neighbourhood in the area with 66 sales at an average of $282,170.  \\nAs for average prices, Bayview checked in at the top of the list with a pair of sales that fetched an average of $868,500.  \\nEau Claire was next with a price of $612,269 for 21 deals.  \\nIn the board's area A, which covers primarily the northwest and part of the northeast, Rocky Ridge Ranch led in sales.  \\nThe community had 46 sales at an average selling price of $291,815, followed by Bridgeland, where 41 sales averaged $332,906.  \\nOne sale in Collingwood carried a pricetag of $557,300, followed by another single sale in Montgomery for $440,000.  \\nA couple of neighbouring communities in the northeast were first and second in sales in area B from April to June.  \\nPineridge had 34 sales averaging $198,597, while Rundle counted 30 sales at an average of $184,693.  \\nAnother pair of neighbours -- Martindale and Taradale -- had the highest average prices in area B at $262,350 and $233,666, respectively.  \\nDown in area D, which covers the city's southeast, McKenzie Towne led the sales parade with 66 at an average price of $263,047.  \\nIt was followed by Acadia, where 34 deals averaged $206,636.  \\nDouglasdale Estates recorded the highest average in the area at $360,000 for a single sale.  \\nMeanwhile, Inglewood had an average price of $337,942 for 21 sales.  \\nIn the board's return area outside the Calgary city limits, Airdrie led the sales parade with 67 sales at an average price of $221,925.  \\nThe highest average selling price was in Priddis Greens, where two sales averaged $482,250.  \",\n          \"Building permits in the Edmonton census metropolitan area slipped in February from last year's values.\\nMunicipalities in the region issued $284.8 million worth of permits in the month. That's down 26.3 per cent from February 2010, but up 20.9 per cent from the previous month, Statistics Canada said Thursday.\\nFor Alberta, the total value of building permits jumped to $1.47 billion. That's up 49.6 per cent from February 2010 and up 112 per cent from the previous month.\\nATB Financial\\n economist Dan Sumner said Alberta's permit values are at the highest level in three years because of a surge in non-residential projects. \\\"The Calgary airport terminal improvement project, valued at nearly $600 million, is the main reason for the increase,\\\" Sumner said.\\nHowever, the value of Alberta's residential building permits fell 35 per cent year-over-year and nearly six per cent month-over-month to $432 million. Sumner said that's the lowest level since June 2009 and indicates housing starts may not recover for a few months yet.\\n\\\"On the residential side of the equation, Edmonton was the primary factor behind February's decrease,\\\" Sumner said. \\\"After seeing a huge surge in residential permits during late 2009 and early 2010, residential construction intentions in the capital have trended back to more normal levels.\\\"\\nAcross Canada, municipalities issued $5.8 billion worth of building permits in February.
